# Idea Me
Android App to help with the collection of ideas into a readable format. This is to replace a custom, hand-written format I was using prior to this - made losing notebooks very upsetting! I collated the format I designed this from from multiple, long forgotten sources on the internet on how to properly design an idea into a usable solution.

## Getting Started

For now, I'm going to be developing the codebase alone, with a view to crowd ourcing at a later date - saying that you basically just need Android Studio and a working knowledge of Java and Kotlin - as that's all I started with!

I am going to be deploying this app to the Play Store as I work through it - I've not decided if I'm going to do a paid and free version yet - for now this is just my own little project and I'll see how I can improve it to help me :)
